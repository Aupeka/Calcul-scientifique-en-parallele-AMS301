# Parallel Scientific Computing (AMS301, ENSTA Paris course)

This repo contains the codes and reports for the two projects in the AMS301 - Parallel Scientific Computing course given in the final year of engineering school at ENSTA Paris (2023). The work was carried out by Adrien Sardi and Nour El Haddad.

The first project, “Structured Grid”, aims to develop two codes for solving finite-difference problems. First with the Jacobi method, then with the Gauss-Siedel method. The codes are then parallelized and their performance evaluated on the Cholesky - Ecole Polytechnique cluster.

The second project aims to complete and improve a parallel finite element calculation code for a stationary problem with an unstructured grid. Firstly, by completing a Jacobi method for solving the problem, then by coding a conjugate gradient method. Finally, the performance of the different codes is evaluated.
